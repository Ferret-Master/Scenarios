Possible gamemodes

- King of the hill

    - players must control one or more marked areas on the map for x time(total or in a row) to win.

- First to do build/store x

- kinda bad one but protect the king, each player has a globally visible king that they cannot control and slowly moves around the map.

- not really a gamemode but dynamic alliance with no vision

- survival

- tower defense


this may not be needed for many gamemodes as they are simple enough to fall udner objective functions.

e.g king of the hill is control area which I wanted anyway
