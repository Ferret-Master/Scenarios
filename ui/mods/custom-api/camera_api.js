/*

the goal of this api is to expand upon the vanilla camera api to add in a few main functions.

for most of these this also needs a way to tempoarily prevent player control of the camera.

most of these functions would have an optional jump back feature that brings you back to your origonal viewpoint

- Pan to target(does what the name suggests)

- jump to location(as name suggests, optonal time for it to stay there)

- execute preset(would go through a defined camera control preset for doing scenes/going through the planet. By itself this could be good for guides)
